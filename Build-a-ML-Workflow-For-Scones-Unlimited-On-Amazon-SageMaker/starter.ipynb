One of the nice things about Step Functions is that [workflows can call other workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-stepfunctions.html), so the team can easily plug your workflow into the broader production architecture for Scones Unlimited.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next stage you're going to write and deploy three Lambda functions, and then use the Step Functions visual editor to chain them together! Our functions are going to work with a simple data object:\n",

    "You've reached the end of the project. In this project you created an event-drivent ML workflow that can be incorporated into the Scones Unlimited production architecture. You used the SageMaker Estimator API to deploy your SageMaker Model and Endpoint, and you used AWS Lambda and Step Functions to orchestrate your ML workflow. Using SageMaker Model Monitor, you instrumented and observed your Endpoint, and at the end of the project you built a visualization to help stakeholders understand the performance of the Endpoint over time. If you're up for it, you can even go further with these stretch goals:\n",

    "* Extend your workflow to incorporate more classes: the CIFAR dataset includes other vehicles that Scones Unlimited can identify with this model.\n",
    "* Modify your event driven workflow: can you rewrite your Lambda functions so that the workflow can process multiple image inputs in parallel? Can the Step Function \"fan out\" to accomodate this new workflow?\n",
    "* Consider the test data generator we provided for you. Can we use it to create a \"dummy data\" generator, to simulate a continuous stream of input data? Or a big paralell load of data?\n",
